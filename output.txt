Discrepancy: Maintenance of Road
Corrective Measure: Rain Cuts: Restore using proper backfilling and compaction. Use geotextiles if necessary for stabilization. Vegetation: Regularly trim branches, shrubs, and grass. Ensure clear visibility for road users and prevent obstruction of traffic signs.

Discrepancy: Making up of Earthen Shoulders
Corrective Measure: Ensure proper grading and compaction to match the road level. Regular maintenance is needed to prevent erosion.

Discrepancy: Condition of Pavement
Corrective Measure: Potholes: Fill with appropriate materials (asphalt or concrete) followed by compaction. Patch Repairs: Use a cut-and-patch method for larger areas, ensuring the patch is well integrated with the existing pavement.

Discrepancy: Road Furniture and Markings
Corrective Measure: Regularly repaint road markings. Maintain visibility and positioning of road furniture.

Discrepancy: Geometrics
Corrective Measure: Regularly assess and maintain road alignment, curvature, and gradients to meet design standards.

Discrepancy: Base Course - Water Bound Macadam (WBM)
Corrective Measure: Regularly inspect for surface evenness, and presence of potholes or ruts. For repairs, remove the loose material, re-grade and re-compact the area.

Discrepancy: Cross drainage works
Corrective Measure: Regular cleaning to prevent blockages. Structural inspection and repair of any damages to maintain functionality. In case of significant damage, reconstruct the affected area with fresh WBM layers, ensuring proper gradation of aggregates and adequate binding with stone dust or fine aggregates. Ensure proper water drainage to avoid water logging which can weaken the WBM structure. ... (more discrepancies and corrective measures)
